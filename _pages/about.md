I'm currently an MS student at University of California, San Diego, studying Computer Science (Focus: Artificial Intelligence). I also received my BS in Computer Science and minor in Math from UC San Diego (Class of 2020). I strive to always learn more and experience more such that I can make a positive impact on those around me.

When I'm not doing something programming related, I enjoy trying to pick up heavy objects and moving them from point A to point B (aka powerlifting), reading, baking, and playing Legend of Zelda (or getting wrecked in Valorant).
